# Codsoft-_tictactoeai
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an intelligent AI opponent, built as part of the CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship. This project demonstrates the implementation of an unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm.

üåü Features
Classic Tic-Tac-Toe Gameplay: Play the timeless game of Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI.

Unbeatable AI Opponent: The AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm, ensuring it never makes a losing move. Can you force a draw?

Interactive User Interface: A clean and simple command-line or graphical interface (you can specify which one you built) for intuitive gameplay.

Player vs. AI Mode: Test your skills and strategy against a challenging computer opponent.

Score Tracking: (Optional: Add this if you implemented it) Keeps track of wins, losses, and draws.
